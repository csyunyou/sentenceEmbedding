i really needed immediate attention having just flown in and getting seriously ill . 
the staff saw that i needed to be seen right away and just rushed me through to see the doctor ( allowing me time to fill in all of the essential paperwork after the consult ) . 
no waiting in long lines - this was better than even the emergency room of a hospital in how quickly they got me in to see the doctor . 
doctor was thorough and patient and pretty much diagnosed what i had suspected was wrong . 
i came into the office in almost extreme critical distress and with quick medications and prescribed ones over the next days , within 24 hours i felt like i was almost 90 % on the way to total recovery . 
they even had me come in for a follow up visit the next day to ensure that the meds were taking effect and that i was progressing in my recovery . 
i would highly recommend them to anyone needing immediate attention .
