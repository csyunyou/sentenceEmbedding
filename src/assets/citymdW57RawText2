I really needed immediate attention having just flown in and getting seriously ill. The staff saw that I needed to be seen right away and just rushed me through to see the doctor (allowing me time to fill in all of the essential paperwork after the consult). No waiting in long lines - this was better than even the emergency room of a hospital in how quickly they got me in to see the doctor. Doctor was thorough and patient and pretty much diagnosed what I had suspected was wrong. I came into the office in almost extreme critical distress and with quick medications and prescribed ones over the next days, within 24 hours I felt like I was almost 90% on the way to total recovery. They even had me come in for a follow up visit the next day to ensure that the meds were taking effect and that I was progressing in my recovery. I would highly recommend them to anyone needing immediate attention. Jody L
